This repository includes an example application consisting of two processes to handle payments for orders.
The Payment process first charges the customers' in-house credit.
If and only if the in-house credit is large enough to fully pay the order, the credit card will be charged.

The Payment process is started by the Order process. The Order process can only complete after the payment has been completed successfully.
